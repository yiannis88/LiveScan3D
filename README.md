## Future
Further development is undergo to study the behaviour of a holographic system under various networks (e.g. 5G, 4G, Wi-Fi) with different characteristics. The app has already been modified to run on mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, and not only on hololenses as it was originally developed)

## Issues:
    - If there is an issue with the live show, try to disable the compression level (set it to 0, in the settings)
