# LiveScan3D #
LiveScan3D is a system designed for real time 3D reconstruction using multiple Kinect v2 depth sensors simultaneously at real time speed.

## Multi-source
As part of an under-graduate dissertation, Andy Pack <andrewjpack@gmail.com> is extending the functionality of the suite to include multiple sources. Here a source is defined by the current use case of a single or multiple-view configuration of a single scene. The multisource capabilities will allow multiple locations to be received for simultaneous delivery.

***A technical breakdown of the multi-source extensions can be found in the [readme](docs/README.md) of the docs folder.***
  
## Future
Further development is undergo to study the behaviour of a holographic system under various networks (e.g. 5G, 4G, Wi-Fi) with different characteristics. The app has already been modified to run on mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones, and not only on hololenses as it was originally developed)

## Issues:
    - If there is an issue with the live show, try to disable the compression level (set it to 0, in the settings)
